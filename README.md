# The Tinkerer's Tournament

🚧 Current Status: Work in progress | Technical Prototype 🚧 (exploring game dev through weird and chaotic experiments)

Welcome to The Tinkerer's Tournament, where strategy meets steampunk in a chaotic board game experiment!

## 🏈 What's about?

The Tinkerer's Tournament is a creative playground exploring (almost) modern web game development through a [Blood Bowl x WindJammer x SpeedBall]-inspired strategy game. Built with SvelteKit and ECS architecture, it's both a functional game and a learning journey into game development patterns.

## 🎲 Core Game

- 9x24 grid board with scoring zones
- 2 teams of 5 players each
- 3 distinct character types:
  - Fighters (tough and direct)
  - Runners (fast and agile)
  - Specialists (tricky and technical)
- Turn-based strategy with dice rolls
- Simple but tactical gameplay

📚 The Game Rules Book (Coming Soon)
